# TaskScheduler
Moving Scheduler from Bitbucket to Github. For further developing.

Scheduler presented here is my project for Research Skills course. It performs computations on data from Brunel University (many sets of tasks stated as [time, priority, deadline]).
Of course I also added the possibility to load data from file of your own.

By now I have implemented Simulated Annealing algorithm and slightly modified version of Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO).
